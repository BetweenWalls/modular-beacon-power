[mod-name]
modular-beacon-power=Modular Beacon Power

[mod-description]
modular-beacon-power=Beacons are affected by their own modules. They use less power with efficiency modules and/or more power with speed modules - settings control whether the mod applies to both or just one or the other.

[mod-setting-name]
mbp-apply-efficiency=Apply distribution efficiency
mbp-negative-bonuses=Negative bonuses
mbp-positive-bonuses=Positive bonuses
mbp-update-rate=Time between updates (ticks)
mbp-active-mod=Active mod

[mod-setting-description]
mbp-apply-efficiency=Module bonuses are multiplied by the beacon's distribution efficiency before affecting the beacon
mbp-negative-bonuses=Applies bonuses which reduce beacon power consumption (e.g. efficiency modules)
mbp-positive-bonuses=Applies bonuses which increase beacon power consumption (e.g. speed modules)\nWARNING: May cause memory issues if there are too many beacons and modules - these bonuses are not limited like the negative bonuses are.
mbp-update-rate=How often the game checks individual beacons to update their power consumption, in addition to triggered updates. Higher values will result in better performance, but will take longer to ensure accuracy.
mbp-active-mod=Beacons are updated normally.\nDisable to revert all beacons to their original entities, making it safe to uninstall the mod or change startup settings.
